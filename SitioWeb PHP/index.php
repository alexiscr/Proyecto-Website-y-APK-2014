Daniel DeLeon“If you want to make your business profitable (any business, small or large), then working with Manny Zarate and MDZ should be your starting point.
Manny’s methods are empirical and pragmatic, and while others offer you to do some kind of SEO for your site, he will actually build a proper online marketing strategy (for almost the same price you would be paying for a much inferior service).
As a business analyst, I can tell you that Manny’s strategy is, by far, the clearest path to business success I’ve seen.”
Daniel De <a href="#">Leon, Business Analyst , Toronto, CANADA</a>
 
Dear Business Owner,
 
It can be every business owner’s reoccurring nightmare.
You’ve poured hundreds… if not thousands… of dollars into building the “perfect” website to market your products and services.
Yet you lay awake at night, wondering to yourself… after all that expense and effort…
“Why In The World Doesn’t My Website 
Deliver More Business?”
After all, there is a limitless supply of traffic running right under your fingertips… every single day… and that traffic is made up of real people searching for your products or services online.
They are ready to buy, but…
…there’s something holding them back. Something is keeping them from dealing with you. Instead, they are going to your competitor’s website and buying from them.
So what is that mysterious roadblock keeping you from making more sales and growing your business? The answer is simple…
“It’s Your Online Marketing Strategy!”
 
Big dumb companies put up websites every day without a proper online marketing strategy-and just expect people to magically show up and automatically do business with them.
This is a surefire way of wasting TONS of time, money—and a proven way to get even more frustrated and confused than ever before!
 
Why? Because there are a whole lot of “experts” who preach that…
you need Google rankings
you need links
you’ve gotta have a lot of “likes” and friends via social media.
you want the site to be pretty and have a bunch of fancy graphics
you need this and that
 
You see, there’s one thing that Manny has discovered in his 12 years in marketing…and that there are critical decisions that MUST be made about your website and your Internet strategy.
 
Miss out on this, and you could be forever BANNED from achieving the success and prosperity you deserve. You’ll be forever bouncing around from SEO expert to SEO expert…hoping and praying it’s going to magically help you get more rankings, leads or customers…
 
So if you use sloppy tactics preached by “instant experts” out there on forums and other places online that don’t “walk the walk”…you could be utterly confused for the life of your wealth-building career regarding what makes a REAL online business site “tick”.
 
Listen: the worst thing you can do is assume you just need to have a pretty website and do some kind of SEO, links here, social something there, a little of this or that.
Is that any way to run a real business? No way!
At any rate…
“Something Is Not Working!”
You’re still puzzled. You have a great product or service. You’ve paid a talented designer to create a sleek, appealing site. Maybe you’ve embraced social media, done some internet marketing yourself, or hired and fired many “wanna-be SEOs.”
BUT…
…YOU ARE SIMPLY NOT GETTING THE RESULTS YOU THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE.
 
“But Imagine Having a Website and Online Strategy that Brings In YOUR Ideal Customers, Clients and Patients Like Clockwork”

 
And imagine how easier it’ll make on your life—and how much extra income you’ll be able to use to pay some bills, add more overhead to your operation, or just make it easier to sleep for a change?
 
And imagine what it will feel like that you finally “get” this whole Internet thing that has been eluding you all this time?
